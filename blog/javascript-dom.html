      <h1>Javascript and DOM</h1>
      <div class="main-text">   
          <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS </h3>
          <p>Using the analogy of building a house, html is the basic structure of a house. css is for decoration. 
             A house without decoration is a house, it just doesn't look good. And it is JS that decides whether 
             the house is a hospital, a cinema, or a residence. JS makes it functional and interactive.
          </p>    
          <br>        
          <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
          <p>Use bubble tea as an analogy to Control flow and Loop. The original order should be, boil water, 
             put the tea in the cup, brew the tea, add milk, stir it, and drink the tea. This process is the control 
             flow. But there is also a possibility that when adding milk, it is found that the milk is bad, but the
             bad milk has been added to the tea, so the tea has to be poured out and a new bottle of milk is opened.
             Then take another cup , put the tea in it, brew the tea, add milk, stir, and drink it. 
             The process of putting tea in cup, brewing tea and adding milk is a loop.
           </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
          <p>Using the analogy of a car wheel, the DOM is the steering wheel. Every time I want to turn, I don't 
             need to move the car wheels by myself, but just turn the steering wheel.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
          <p>array[ ]   <br>    
            object.xx</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
          <p>function is the solution to the problem. Prepare the solutions for various problems, and use them 
            directly when you encounter the corresponding problems.
            
            If programming is compared to movable type printing，function is every carved movable type. With
             movable type, there is no need to re-engrave the text every time new content is printed, but to put
              the required movable type in the correct position, it can play its function.
            
          <h3>DevTools</h3>
          <p>DevTools is a lab.Take an example of a manufacturing machine In the process of development,
             production and troubleshooting, a machine needs continuous experimentation, testing and debugging.
             DevTools is the laboratory of the code.</p>

      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Hard to focus.</li>
          <li>It's actually pretty fun if I stuck with a problem and figure out a solution.</li>
          <li>Rewarding myself is a good way to form a habit.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Curiosity drives me to be interested in new content, especially content that sees results, like those games.
          </li>
          <li>
            Empthy (if I understand correctly) allowed myself to think and improve functionality from a user's view
          </li>
          <li>Self awareness has always been in a supervisory role, trying to make me work harder.</li>
        </ul>
          
      
      
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Keeping a diary is so useful, use it to talk to yourself and clear your head of junk. 
          And the Pomodoro, a short break can greatly improve my continuous learning ability
        </p>

      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The lack of confidence in the use of English has caused me some troubles. I hope that in the next study, 
          I will focus on my learning and use English only as a tool, instead of making it an obstacle to learning.
        </p>

      <h3>
      Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in 
      a web development bootcamp course?
      </h3>
        <p>
        Through the past 5 weeks of study, I feel that if there is no core part of the study, the technical part of
        the study may be very difficult, when self-doubt, when the learning content is difficult to coordinate, etc.
        Core is on a higher dimension, teaching me how to learn and how to overcome difficulties.
        </p>

      <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used 
      that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
        <p>
          The most surprising part of learning core is that many of the contents it introduces are highly consistent
          with some books I have read before, such as "Flow", such as "Atomic Habits" which is very important to me.
          Those books were very beneficial when I read them, but I didn't really put them into practice.
          The core courses not only enriched my knowledge in this area, but also gave me the opportunity to keep 
          practicing it. Being able to learn good study methods and beneficial ways of thinking is also the direction I have always 
          wanted to work towards. 
          
          Because the Tech part took more time, the 5-week Core practice has not turned it into a part of myself. 
          In bootcamp, I hope that I can absorb and digest its content through more study, and apply it lastingly in future
          study, work and life.

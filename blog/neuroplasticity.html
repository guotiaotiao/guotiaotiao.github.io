          <h3> Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset </h3>
          <p>
            I myself came across this concept many years after becoming an adult. Thinking about the experiences
            growing up, and the thinking patterns of the people around, it’s really the fixed mindset that dominates.
            As if only "innate" abilities could be affirmed. So everyone tries to make things easy, or is always 
            trying ways to make a blockbuster without effort, everything is in pursuit of quick success：like how to 
            lose 20kg in a week, how to master a language in 3 days. . . Because if you work hard for years achieve
            results  which someone else  achieved easily , you will only become a person who is not smart but only
            works hard, but smart is the quality we pursuit. Fundamentally, it is the innate divine power that is
            admired. So everyone wants to be a "genius". What if you find out that you are not a genius? It will be 
            a nightmare. After failure, I can't cheer up. I believe that no matter how hard I work, , I can't succeed 
            at all because I'm not a genius. Life is stagnant, there is no hope anymore. <br>
            <br>
            Is that the truth? <br>
            <br>
            It was a blessing to learn about Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset. No matter what stage of life you are 
            in, you can ignite the flame of hope, and there should be no more moments of despair and disappointment 
            with yourself. Because as long as you keep trying, find a method that suits you, and keep working hard, 
            you will definitely become a better self. <br>
            <br>
            In the recent learning process of foundation, when I encounter difficulties, the fixed mindset will jump 
            out from time to time. For example, when I came into contact with some brand-new concepts for the first 
            time, and temporarily couldn't connect them with the existing knowledge system and cognitive framework, 
            those new knowledge seemed to be floating in the air, but I couldn't catch them. At this point, I would 
            be very frustrated and start to wonder if I am too stupid, if I have no ability to learn coding at all, 
            if all this is a wrong decision.In fact, these difficulties will always pass, and when I start to 
            understand them, what I thought I could not do, I can do. <br>
            <br>
            In this process of going from impossible to being able, a few things are helpful, when exposed to new
            concepts, new knowledge, unable to understand and master, go to google different resources written by 
            different people. Different examples explaining the same concept and knowledge is easier to understand 
            than a single dimension, because everyone's thinking logic is various and their expressions are different.
            For example, let's say I see an orange, and when I start looking at it from the side and top, it's actually 
            half an orange, and if I don't change the angle, I always think it's a whole orange . Explaining the same 
            concept from different angles and sources is like looking at the same orange from different angles.

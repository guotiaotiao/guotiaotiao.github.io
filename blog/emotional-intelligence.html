          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>EQ refers to a person's "emotional intelligence"
             it represents a person's emotional intelligence, that is, a person's ability 
              to manage one's own emotions and manage the emotions of others. It depends on whether a person is
               passionate about work and life, whether he is a person with "sympathy" and "sensitivity", and at
                the same time whether he can trust others and stimulate each other's potential. Emotional 
                intelligence includes self-control, enthusiasm, persistence, and the ability to be self-motivated
                 and self-motivated.</p>

          <h3>How is it different to IQ??</h3>
            <p>The relationship between EQ and IQ is like a mountain. IQ is just the foot of the mountain and the 
              foundation for future performance. Without IQ, many skills cannot be learned. EQ determines how high
               a person can climb, and EQ is proportional to the degree of excellence. And IQ is difficult to change, 
               EQ can be improved through training.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
            <p>EQ determines how difficult it is to survive in society, and a high EQ can lead to a more successful life.</p>

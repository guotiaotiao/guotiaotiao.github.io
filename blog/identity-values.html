    <p class="blog-text">
    Something I have thinking about in terms of value and identity is curiosity. 
    Most of my life experience is made up of curiosity. I am curious about many things and want to 
    explore to find out what I really want. Just like many years ago, the problem that bothered me 
    the most was that I didn’t know what I wanted. Later, it was curiosity that led to my life 
    experience, and it was the experience that shaped who I am now. Gradually, I know what I want and 
    gradually understand myself, from the excessive self-blame to reconciliation with myself. I believe 
    curiosity can take a person anywhere, no matter physical or imagined.

    I have been slowly shaping my life with good habits in recent years, little by little. Although 
    everyone is not perfect, we can still make ourselves a little better than we were yesterday. 
    Learning to code is also a part of shaping oneself. Learning coding can learn how to think and how 
    to solve problems, which extends to all aspects of life, which is a change in thinking mode. Isn't
    that what EDA intends to teach us? I'm glad my friend recommended EDA to me. Very much looking 
    forward to the day I officially become a developer!

          <h3>2. Study</h3>
                
         <li>
           In learning progress and content, try to complete the course and homework of the week 
           before Friday, and start the next week's class on Saturday. Every week, I bring a little unfamiliar 
           content from bootcamp, such as redux, node, plant a seed in my mind, and let it grow itself for a while.
        </li>
                
         <li>When got stuck, google and ask questions</li>
                
         <li>
           When self-doubt, write a diary to talk to myself, read the core content 
           summarized before, such as make it big by starting small, such as growth mindset. 
         </li>

          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <li>
            The long-term goal is to be a good full stack developer. I hope I can encourage more people to l
            earn coding through 
            my transformation experience.
            </li>
          
            <li>
            What I want to learn from the course is: have basic work ability, can smoothly integrate into the 
            work environment, good teamwork, do not make low-level mistakes, and do not cause trouble to the team.
            </li>
          
          
            <br>    

          <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            <li>
               When I see my progress and find that I can solve problems better and better, it will definitely 
               give me more confidence and energy. Excessive self-doubt and overconfidence are not good. I have to 
               learn how to encourage myself when I have doubts, and how to push myself to continue to work hard when 
               I being satisfied with a little achievement.
            </li>
                
            <li>
               Also, the performance of other people has a great influence on me. I hope I can focus on learning the 
               good aspects of other people and not let myself be overly anxious.
            </li>
                
            <li>
               Also, I have to prepare for possible obstacles, such as what to do when I feel sick, what to do when I 
               can't concentrate, what to do when I encounter a low mood. Make plans for possible situations, in case 
               there is no coping strategy at that time, which will affect the learning effect. The purpose is 
               that no matter what difficulties I encounter, I must persevere and devote myself to it. No matter 
               what happens, there is no excuse.
            </li>
            <br>
          
          <h3>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?Non-technical challenges might 
            include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused 
            for 9 weeks, etc.
          </h3>
            <p>
              All of the above could be a hindrance for me. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will come from keeping focused 
              for 9 weeks. Because I may be self-doubt because I can’t meet my expectations and thus affect my 
              enthusiasm, but I will keep reminding myself in my daily diary and make corresponding solutions for each 
              possibility in advance.
            </p>

          <h3>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h3>
            <p>
              Maybe share some specific experiences and suggestions of past EDA students.
            </p>
            <br>

          <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            <p>Always tell me if my current state is as expected, and if it's not doing well, just point it out.</p>
            <br>

          <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>

              <li>
                Complete all courses and assignments without any excuses. To avoid high-intensity sessions that can 
                lead to avoidance or weak, self- doubting outcomes, it's important to think ahead about how to deal with them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Actively participate in group work.  I will push myself to make my voice.
              </li> 
              <li>
                Learn ideas and methods from peers. The irreplaceable advantage of a group learning together is that 
                we can learn from each other, be influenced, inspired. The power of a team is greater than that of an 
                individual.
              </li>
              <li>
                When encountering difficulties that cannot be solved by yourself,  seek help from the students and 
                facilitators. If I can, I want to help others as much as possible. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Communicate with myself by writing a diary every day, making plans in the morning and reflecting in 
                the evening.
              </li>
              <li>
                Seek the opinions of others and improve myself with opinions from different perspectives. Get rid of 
                the bad habit of being afraid of being evaluated, and grow through objective evaluation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Completion is better than perfection.
              </li>
              <li>
                When it is found that the existing plan is no longer effective, adjust the plan in time.
              </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1. Habits</h3>
          <li>Get up early, morning is the most important part of study during a day.</li>
          
          <li>Before going to bed,make a conclude for the day,make a plan for the coming day. </li>
          
          <li> Exercise, </li>

          <h3>2. Study</h3>
                
         <li>
           In learning progress and content, try to complete the course and homework of the week 
           before Friday, and start the next week's class on Saturday. Every week, I bring a little unfamiliar 
           content from bootcamp, such as redux, node, plant a seed in my mind, and let it grow itself for a while.
        </li>
                
         <li>When got stuck, google and ask questions</li>
                
         <li>
           When self-doubt, write a diary to talk to myself, read the core content 
           summarized before, such as make it big by starting small, such as growth mindset. 
         </li>

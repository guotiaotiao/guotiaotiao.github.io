            <p>
              There is an object named "terah", I now need add a key value pair "spouse:adam" to "terah",so I did this.
            </p>
              <img class="problem-solving" src="../pic/problem solving/1.png" alt="pic" ></img>
            <p>
              <br>
              Then I got this:
            </p>
              <img class="problem-solving" src="../pic/problem solving/2.png" alt="pic" ></img>
            <p>
              <br>
              Why?I have added the property to terah already, how come is it not working?Let me console.log it to see 
              what's wrong with it.             
            </p>
              <img class="problem-solving" src="../pic/problem solving/3.png" alt="pic" ></img>
              <img class="problem-solving" src="../pic/problem solving/4.png" alt="pic" ></img>
            <p>
              <br>
              What?Undefined?Is it other property working well in "terah"? Or just new property not working?
              So I tried this:
            </p>
              <img class="problem-solving" src="../pic/problem solving/5.png" alt="pic" ></img>
              <img class="problem-solving" src="../pic/problem solving/6.png" alt="pic" ></img>
            <p>
              <br>
              It did work well. So the proble is made by me, the hint must be on the code piece "spouse:adam",am I 
              spell it right? Yes, I am. Is the syntax right? Yes it is right.So what is the problem? 
              Finally I got it.
            </p>
              <img class="problem-solving" src="../pic/problem solving/7.png" alt="pic" ></img>
            <p>
              <br>
              I added the property "spouse:adam" into the original object "terah",which is not the right way which 
              I thought it was.And there is an instruction on the top in comments:"Do not alter this object by adding
               anything within the curly braces!" I was blind. After realizing it, I did this:
            </p>
              <img class="problem-solving" src="../pic/problem solving/8.png" alt="pic" ></img>
            <p>
              <br>
              Now I got the result:
            </p>
              <img class="problem-solving" src="../pic/problem solving/9.png" alt="pic" ></img>
            <p>
              <br>
              For a moment I felt stupid, but as a person who is developing growth mindset and neuroplasticity, "stupid" 
              should not be a self-assement word, so I let it go. Haha.

              <h3>This week I learnt a lot problem solving techniques/processes,how confident do I use them?</h3>

                <p>
                  I used all techniques above during the last four weeks, and getting better and better in some part 
                  of them,like "console.logging" and "reading error message". At the beginning once I stuck the only 
                  thing I can do was looking for help from others, but now, I have started solving problem by myself. 
                  Next, I will practise more on other techniques which are not mastered so far, if I found other techniques
                  besides these, I will share with the team.
